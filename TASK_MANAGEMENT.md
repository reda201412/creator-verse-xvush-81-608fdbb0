# Task Management for Creator-Verse

This document outlines the task management system for the Creator-Verse project.

## Available Commands

### List Tasks
```bash
npm run task:list
```

### Add a New Task
```bash
npm run task:add -- "Task title" "Task description" [priority] [status]
```

### Update a Task
```bash
npm run task:update -- <task-id> "New title" "New description" [new-priority] [new-status]
```

### Mark a Task as Complete
```bash
npm run task:complete -- <task-id>
```

## Task Statuses
- `pending`: Task is waiting to be started
- `in-progress`: Task is currently being worked on
- `in-review`: Task is under review
- `done`: Task is completed
- `blocked`: Task is blocked by external factors

## Priority Levels
- `high`: Critical task that needs immediate attention
- `medium`: Important but not urgent
- `low`: Low priority task

## Implementation Notes
Due to .gitignore restrictions, the task management system is implemented using npm scripts that can be extended with actual task management functionality as needed. The current setup provides a foundation that can be integrated with a proper task management system in the future.
